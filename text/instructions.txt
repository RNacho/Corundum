To compile simply run:
	make library
If you want to test the library compile with:
	make all
Then for simple tests run:
	./executableLinux

The static library will be the file named:
	libCorundum.a
To include the library in your project use:
	#include "/path/to/folder/headers/Corundum.h"
	IMPORTANT; You must have the other headers as well //Maybe change this?
And compile with:
	cc yourFile.c -L/path/to/library -lCorundum

To clean residual compilation files run:
	make clean
To clean all compiled files (including libCorundum.a and executableLinux) run:
	make reset
